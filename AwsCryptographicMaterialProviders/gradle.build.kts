// This is an example of an all-pieces-in-one-build configuration.
// In practice they will often be split apart much more.
// Especially in Brazil, so that each piece has a single simple build-system.
// There may need to be some ordering/dependencies tweaks
// to make sure the plugins apply in the right order.

// Following a major tenet here of putting all generated code/assets
// under build/..., and in complete projects.
// Besides following suit with how existing Smithy tools work,
// this should clarify the architecture of how things fit together
// (especially being more explicit about how wrapped clients work),
// avoid complicated .gitignore files,
// and allow Gradle to not repeat work when inputs to individual tasks
// have not changed.

// The project directory after building everything might look like:
// (TODO: need replaceable modules too)
// (TODO: smithyprojections strucure a little unclear, probably needs a library name in there too)
// (TODO: fill in more source files to make flow clearer)
// (TODO: missing native language dependencies - need to declare categories of dependencies sources)
// (TODO: Have Java externs in proper separate Java project)
// (TODO: How do I dry run publishing everything)
// (TODO: Look into how SDKs deal with dependabot)

    // Most of these will already be transitive Dafny-*-API dependencies.

    // In practice these will often be inside the same repo and configured as sister Gradle projects,
    // so it's easy to build recursively when you want to.
    //
    // Mapping of polymorph dependencies will be pluggable and have fallback behavior:
    // * The default case is using convention to map the Smithy service name to the target language library artifact name,
    //   but then verifying the artifact is correct by looking for the Smithy/Polymorph-attached metadata.
    // * If that fails, use target language repository indexing to look for a package that includes a known class/type,
    //   like software.amazon.cryptography.primitives.AtomicPrimitives.
    //   This allows polymorph libraries to be merged as they are polymorphed,
    //   while still allowing source dependencies to the components.
    // * Can also provide custom indexing, if you really need to fallback to registering with some system
    //   whenever a polymorphed library is published somewhere,
    //   but better to avoid additional stateful systems.
    //
    // This mapping can be cached locally by Gradle, and/or locked down with some kind of lock file.\
    //
    // Dafny itself could use a similar approach, if Dafny projects have an identity
    // and a convention for mapping those identifiers to target language ecosystems.
